For this capstone project I have analyzed some 911 calls data from Kaggle. 

The data contains the following fields:
	lat : String variable, Latitude
	lng: String variable, Longitude
	desc: String variable, Description of the Emergency Call
	zip: String variable, Zipcode
	title: String variable, Title
	timeStamp: String variable, YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
	twp: String variable, Township
	addr: String variable, Address
	e: String variable, Dummy variable (always 1)

Using this data I have analyzed what were the major reasons behind 911 Emergency Calls along with which hour, which day of the week and which month had the highest number of emergency calls.
